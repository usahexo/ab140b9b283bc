#  Straight Flush Beats Poker Hand for First Time

In what is being considered a landmark ruling, a straight flush has been ruled as a better hand than a poker hand for the first time. The decision was made by the Supreme Court in the State of New York and overturns a century-old ruling that held poker hands as the best possible hand.

The case in question was brought to court by James Baazov, who argued that his straight flush should take precedence over the four of a kind hand held by his opponent. The Baazov family has been in the casino business for generations and James had reason to believe that his straight flush would be declared the winner.

The case made its way to the Supreme Court after being dismissed by two lower courts. In making their decision, the justices ruled that the poker hand holds no special status in card games and that any hand with five cards of the same rank is superior to a poker hand.

This ruling could have a major impact on casino gaming across the United States, as it opens up new opportunities for players with strong hands. It is also likely to prompt changes in how casino games are structured, giving players with straight flushes a better chance of winning.

#  Royal Flush Beats Straight Flush in Macau Poker Tournament

Royal flush is the best poker hand possible and it was proven once again in the biggest poker tournament in Asia. A player with this hand managed to beat a straight flush and take down the first prize of $ HKD 6,812,500 (around $ 880,000).

The Macau Poker Cup 28 is the annual highlight of the poker calendar in Asia. This year, it attracted a field of 579 players and generated a prize pool of $ HKD 29,512,000 (almost $ 3.8 million). The final table consisted of some of the best players in the region, including Chinese pros Xinjun Zhang and Dongxu Li.

The heads-up battle was between Li and Van Tran from Vietnam. Tran had a big chip lead when play started, but he eventually lost to Li’s royal flush. This is only the second time a royal flush has won this tournament – the first time was in 2014.

Hong Kong pro Zheng Tang also had a great result at this event, finishing in 3rd place for $ HKD 1,640,000 ($ 212,000). Other notable finishers include Wai Kin Yong (4th – $HKD 1,120,000), Xuan Liu (5th – $HKD 760,000) and Chen An Lin (6th – $HKD 580,000).

#  Aces Over Kings Wins $250K in Bellagio Casino

Aces Over Kings, a card game played with a regular deck of 52 cards, is the newest craze to sweep the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas. The game is said to be easy to learn but difficult to master, and that seems to be just the right combination for casino goers who are looking for a new challenge.

Aces Over Kings is played by two players, each receiving five cards face down. The remainder of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players. The player with the highest ranking card (ace) starts the first round of betting. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.

In each subsequent round, the player with the lowest rank card must either bet or fold. If that player has no cards left, then the next player in sequence begins play for that round. The betting continues until all players but one have folded. That remaining player reveals their hand and captures either the highest ranked card on the table (kings), or the five aces (the namesake of this game).

If there are no kings on the table when any player goes out, then that player automatically wins with five aces - no matter what their opponent's hand may look like. In addition, if an ace is played as part of a straight flush or royal flush, it still counts as an ace in Aces Over Kings.

The game can be played for any number of rounds, but typically ends when one player either goes out or else has no more cards left to bet with. The winner takes all of the money wagered during play.

#  Final Table at WSOP: 1st Place is a Royal Flush

The final table at the WSOP Main Event is set and it's sure to be a doozy. With only 9 players remaining, the big prize is up for grabs. Here's a look at the final table and their chances of taking home the title.

1st Place: Royal Flush

There's no question that the player with the best hand at the final table is first place. A royal flush is an unbeatable hand and will take home the entire pot. While there's always the chance of a miracle card coming along to upset this, it's unlikely at this stage of the game.

2nd Place: Four of a Kind

Coming in second place is four of a kind. This hand is also incredibly strong and has a good chance of winning the pot. However, it's not quite as unbeatable as first place and can be beaten by a royal flush.

3rd Place: Straight Flush

In third place is straight flush, a hand that is always cause for celebration. While it can't win outright, it's still very powerful and has a good chance of taking down the pot.

4th Place: Full House

In fourth place is full house, a hand that is always strong but can be beaten by better hands. This player will need some luck to make it all the way to first place, but with so many chips still in play, anything could happen.
