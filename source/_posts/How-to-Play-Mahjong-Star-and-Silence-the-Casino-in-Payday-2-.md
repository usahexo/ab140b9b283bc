#  How to Play Mahjong Star and Silence the Casino in Payday 2 

Mahjong Star and Silence the Casino are two Payday 2 heists that can be completed on lower difficulties. The goal of Mahjong Star is to find a specific mahjong tile and steal the enforcer's money. The goal of Silence the Casino is to stealthily kill all of the security guards in the casino.

The following guide will show you how to complete both heists on normal difficulty.

## How to Complete Mahjong Star 
The first step in completing Mahjong Star is finding the correct mahjong tile. There are five different tiles that can be used, and four of them are located in relatively easy locations.

The first tile is in the top left corner of the map. The second tile is in the bottom right corner of the map. The third tile is in front of the safe room. The fourth tile is on a small table next to one of the monitors in the north side of the map.

The fifth and final tile is located in a small room near the entrance to the casino. This room can be reached by going through a door on the right side of the map or by going through a door on the left side of the map and then taking a right at the end of the hallway.

Once you have found all five tiles, take them to either hostages or loot bags and then escape. 

## How to Complete Silence the Casino 
The first step in completing Silence the Casino is stealthily killing all of the security guards in the casino. There are six guards in total, and they can be killed from either behind or from above.

The first guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon. The second guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol. The third guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol. The fourth guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol.. The fifth guard can be killed from above by jumping onto his head from a ledge near where he is standing.. The sixth guard can be killed from above by jumping onto his head from a ledge near where he is standing or by shooting him with a sniper rifle.. 

Once all six security guards have been killed, take their weapons and then escape

#  How to Beat the Mahjong Star Game and Disable the Casino Sounds in Payday 2 

In this article, we are going to show you how to beat the Mahjong Star game in Payday 2 and disable the casino sounds.

The Mahjong Star game can be found in the back room of the Golden Grin Casino. To beat the game, you need to clear all of the tiles from the board.

To disable the casino sounds, you need to edit a file called payday2_win32.ini. This file can be found in the \Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\ folder.

Open the payday2_win32.ini file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad), and find the line that says snd_cas_gameover = 1. Change this line so that it says snd_cas_gameover = 0 instead, then save and close the file.

#  How to Win at Mahjong Star and Make the Casino Quiet in Payday 2 
Mahjong is a slow-paced game that only requires a small amount of concentration and some strategic thinking. The tiles are placed in a 4x4 square, and the goal is to remove all of the tiles from the board. Mahjong can be played with two or four people, and there are several variations of the game.

In Mahjong Star, you play against three other players. The goal is to remove all of the tiles from the board, and the player with the fewest points at the end of the game wins. Points are awarded for each tile that is removed, and certain tiles are worth more points than others.

The first step is to select a starting tile. This tile will be used to begin your chain. You can then select any adjacent tile and remove it from the board. If you can't move, then you can discard one of your tiles and select another one from the deck.

When selecting a tile to remove from the board, try to choose one that will cause the most damage to your opponents. For example, if you have two suits of bamboo left on your board, it's best to remove a bamboo tile from an opponent's board instead of removing a flower tile from your own board. This will ensure that you get as many points as possible for each move.

There are several special tiles in Mahjong Star that can help you win the game. The wind tiles are worth 5 points each, and they can be used to clear away multiple pieces at once. The dragon tiles are also worth 5 points each, and they can be used to clear away any type of tile.

If you're stuck and can't make any more moves, then you can use a wild card to select any tile that you want. The wild card is also helpful when trying to block your opponents' moves. If an opponent has no more moves left, then you can use the wild card to win the game.

Mahjong Star is a fun and challenging game that can be played by people of all ages. Try out this game today and see how quickly you can win!

#  How to Get Ahead in Mahjong Star and Silence the Annoying Casino Noise in Payday 2 

Mahjong Star and Payday 2 are both games that can provide hours of enjoyment. However, there are a few annoyances that can interfere with the experience. In Mahjong Star, the casino noise in the background can be quite loud and, in Payday 2, the police sirens and other sound effects can be overwhelming at times. This article will provide a few tips on how to get ahead in these games and silence the annoying casino noise and police sirens.

Mahjong Star

The best way to get ahead in Mahjong Star is to focus on building your multiplier. The multiplier increases the amount of points you earn for each match and, as it increases, it becomes harder to lose your progress. You can increase your multiplier by making matches of four or more tiles and by using power-ups. The best way to use power-ups is to wait until you have a lot of tiles that can be matched easily and then use a power-up to maximize your score. The next step is to focus on getting high scores. There are three ways to get high scores: by clearing boards quickly, by matching many tiles at once, or by using power-ups wisely. Try to use all of these strategies to get the highest scores possible.

Payday 2

In Payday 2, the best way to get ahead is to complete heists quickly and efficiently. This will allow you to gain experience points and money at a faster rate. In order to complete heists quickly, you need to master the game’s mechanics and use teamwork effectively. You also need to make sure you have the right equipment for the job. Another important factor is staying calm under pressure. If you panic during a heist, you will likely make mistakes that will cost you time and money. Finally, pay attention to the environment and take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.
