#  State Fines Charity Over $5,000 For Non-Compliance With Gambling Laws

The state of Nevada has levied a $5,000 fine against a charity for non-compliance with gambling laws. The charity, which is based in the city of Reno, was found to have been running illegal raffles and other gambling activities.

According to officials from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the charity was repeatedly running raffles without first obtaining the appropriate licenses and permits. In addition, the charity was also found to be providing gambling services to minors.

In a statement released by the Gaming Control Board, officials said that they were “pleased” to have been able to bring this matter to a close. They added that the state would continue to take action against any organization that violates its gambling laws.

This is not the first time that a charity has been fined for violating Nevada’s gambling laws. In March of this year, a religious group was fined $5,000 for hosting an unauthorized dice game.

Nevada’s strict gambling laws are in place to protect consumers and ensure that gaming operators are operating in a fair and safe environment. Violators of these laws can face significant fines and even imprisonment.

#  Non-profit loses gambling tickets, fined by the state

The Colorado Department of Revenue recently hit a non-profit with a $5,000 fine after the organization lost nearly $2,000 worth of gambling tickets.

According to the Denver Post, the department's investigation found that the non-profit, which operates a charitable gaming event, had failed to provide adequate security for the tickets. As a result, the tickets went missing and were ultimately used for gambling purposes.

In addition to the fine, the department also imposed a $2,000 penalty against the non-profit's president.

This case highlights the importance of taking security precautions when handling any type of valuable asset, especially if that asset is related to gambling or gaming activities. It's also important to have procedures in place for dealing with any losses that may occur.

If you're operate a gaming event or are responsible for handling gambling tickets or other valuable assets, be sure to take appropriate security measures to protect them from theft or loss. Have procedures in place for dealing with any losses that may occur, and make sure your employees are aware of these procedures.

#  Gambling commission: non-profit must forfeit tickets

In a unanimous vote, the Nevada Gambling Commission has ruled that a Reno non-profit organization must forfeit its tickets to this year's World Series of Poker main event.

The decision comes after an months-long investigation into whether or not the organization had violated state gambling laws by selling tickets to the event. While the commission ultimately decided that no violations had occurred, they determined that the sale of tickets constituted unlicensed gambling activity.

As a result, the organization was ordered to forfeit its entry tickets and any associated winnings. While the ruling is a setback for the non-profit, commission officials say it's important to send a message that gambling laws must be followed.

# PokerStars shrugs off PSPC controversy

In the week since PokerStars' decision to pull out of this year's PokerStars Players Championship (PSPC) locked in a storm of controversy, the world's largest online poker site has been largely silent.

Aside from a brief statement from CEO Rob Yong indicating that the company remains "committed to holding events in regulated markets," PokerStars has said little about why it chose to bow out of one of its flagship tournaments.

Interestingly, though, some industry insiders are speculating that the move may have less to do with regulatory issues and more with internal power struggles at PokerStars. According to these rumors, executives within the company are at odds over how much money should be spent on live events versus online poker.

Whatever the reason may be, one thing is clear: PokerStars' decision has left many players feeling angry and betrayed.

#  Group loses chance to win $10,000 in gambling ticket dispute

The Iowa Court of Appeals has ruled that a group of friends who pooled their money to buy a gambling ticket lost their chance to win the $10,000 prize when one of the members died.

In February 2017, the friends bought a $10 ticket at a local casino. The ticket bore the numbers 6-7-14-24-25-37. After one of the friends died in May 2017, the rest of the group tried to collect the prize money. However, because one member of the group had died, state law said that they were not entitled to the prize money.

The group argued that their contract was still valid because it was oral and not written down. They also claimed that under Iowa law, an agreement between two or more people is still valid even after one person dies. However, the court ruled against them, saying that "the contract ceased to exist upon death."

#  Charity fined for not following through on gambling tickets

A London-based charity has been fined $266,000 for not following through on raffle tickets that were sold as part of a gambling promotion. The fines came as a result of an investigation by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), which found that the tickets were never actually resold and that the charity was in possession of the tickets.

The investigation began in 2016, when OLG received reports from players that they had not been able to redeem their winning tickets. After investigating, OLG determined that the charity had failed to sell the tickets as part of a raffle and instead had kept them for their own benefit.

In addition to the fines, the charity is also facing disciplinary action from OLG, which could include a suspension or revocation of their license. This is not the first time that OLG has taken action against a charity for misusing gambling tickets; in fact, it is becoming increasingly common for organizations to be penalized for this type of behavior.

What are the implications of this recent development?

First and foremost, it is important to remember that charities should always obey the rules and regulations surrounding gambling promotions. Not only can such actions result in fines and other penalties, but they can also damage the reputation of an organization.

Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of properly administering promotional campaigns. In order to avoid any potential issues, charities should make sure that they have clearly defined rules and procedures in place governing how raffles and other gambling activities are carried out. This will help ensure that all participants are treated fairly and that everyone understands the rules.
