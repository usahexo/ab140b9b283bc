#  Washington Nationals Fans Can Now Bet on Games at Local Banks!

Starting this season, Washington Nationals fans will have a new way to place bets on their favorite team’s games. A new partnership between the Nationals and local banks allows fans to make in-game wagers at ATMs and online banking platforms.

The partnership is the first of its kind in Major League Baseball, and officials are hopeful that it will increase fan engagement and excitement around the game. In addition to traditional bets on the outcome of a game, fans can now also wager on player stats and specific moments during the game.

“We are always looking for new ways to enhance the fan experience at Nationals Park, and this partnership with local banks does just that,” said Nationals President and Managing Partner Mark D. Lerner in a statement announcing the partnership. “Fans now have another way to get engaged in the games and can root for their hometown team while betting on different aspects of the action.”

Officials say that only adults age 21 or older will be allowed to place bets, and that all regulations surrounding gambling will be strictly enforced. Bank employees will not be allowed to place bets on behalf of customers.

Local bank officials are optimistic about the new partnership. “This is a great opportunity for us to connect with our customers and enhance their experience with baseball and our bank,” said Sandy Pagnotti, senior vice president at Sandy Spring Bank. “We are looking forward to working closely with the Nationals organization to make this a successful initiative.”
