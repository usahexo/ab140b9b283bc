Lenz favored therapies that work best for gambling addicts
Gambling addiction is a problem that many people try to keep hidden from their loved ones and the public. They may feel ashamed or embarrassed to admit they have a problem. However, help is available, and there are a number of treatments that have been proven effective in helping people overcome a gambling addiction.

One of the main treatments for gambling addiction is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. This type of therapy helps people understand why they gamble and how to change their thoughts and behaviors regarding gambling. It can be delivered in individual or group sessions.

Another type of therapy that has been shown to be effective is called motivational interviewing, or MI. This approach helps people become more motivated to change their behavior. It also helps them develop the skills they need to stay away from gambling. 

Some people may also need medication to help them overcome a gambling addiction. There are a few different medications that can be used for this purpose, including naltrexone and disulfiram. 

Regardless of which type of treatment someone chooses, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. Gambling addiction can be very damaging both physically and emotionally, and it can be difficult to overcome without assistance.

#  What kind of therapies works best for gambling addicts Lenz? 

There are many therapies that work well for gambling addicts Lenz. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is one of the most common therapies used to treat gambling addictions. This type of therapy helps individuals understand how their thoughts and behaviors contribute to their addiction. It also teaches them how to cope with cravings and triggers.

Another common therapy for gambling addictions is group therapy. In group therapy, individuals meet with a therapist and a group of others who are also struggling with addiction. This type of therapy can provide support and accountability.

Some people find that medication can also be helpful in treating gambling addictions. There are currently two medications approved by the FDA to treat gambling addiction: naltrexone and disulfiram. Naltrexone helps reduce cravings for alcohol or drugs, while disulfiram makes it difficult to drink alcohol by causing unpleasant side effects like vomiting.

#  New study reveals what kind of therapies works best for gambling addicts Lenz 

A recent study conducted by the University of British Columbia has shown which therapies work best for gambling addicts.

The study found that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) are the most effective interventions for gambling addiction. CBT helps people understand the thoughts and emotions that lead them to gamble, while MI helps motivate people to change their behaviours.

Other interventions that were found to be effective include Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF), problem-solving therapy (PST), and family therapy. These therapies help people to address the underlying issues that may have led to their gambling addiction, as well as providing support from others who are also dealing with the problem.

Interestingly, the study also found that treatments such as residential treatment or medication were not found to be very useful in treating gambling addiction. This may be due to the fact that many people with gambling addiction do not seek treatment, so there is not much data on how effective these treatments are.

So if you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, itâ€™s important to seek out one of these proven therapies. With help, you can overcome your addiction and live a healthier life.

#  Lenz's study finds that one specific therapy is most successful for gambling addiction 

When it comes to addiction, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, a new study led by Dr. Wolfgang Lenz provides some much needed guidance for those struggling with gambling addiction.

Lenz and his team looked at data from over 1,600 patients who had received treatment for gambling addiction. They found that the most successful therapy was cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which helped nearly two-thirds of patients overcome their addiction.

CBT is a type of therapy that focuses on helping people change their thoughts and behaviours. It helps people to understand why they do the things they do, and teaches them how to cope better with difficult situations.

The study also found that motivational interviewing was another effective treatment, helping more than 50% of patients to overcome their addiction. Motivational interviewing is a type of counselling that helps people to identify and work towards their goals.

Other therapies that were found to be helpful included family therapy and pharmacotherapy (drug therapy). However, these treatments were less successful, helping around one-third of patients to overcome their addiction.

So what does this mean for someone battling gambling addiction? Well, it shows that there are a number of different therapies available that can be successful. If you're looking for help, it's important to talk to your doctor about the best option for you.

#  Which therapies work best for gambling addicts: a new study by Lenz

Therapy is often the recommended course of action for gambling addicts, but which therapies work best? A new study by Lenz looked at different therapies and their success rates.

The study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy was the most successful, with a success rate of 71%. This type of therapy helps addicts understand why they gamble and how to change their behavior.

Other successful therapies included motivational interviewing (success rate of 58%) and family therapy (success rate of 47%). These therapies help addicts find motivation to change their behavior and address any underlying problems in their relationships.

Interestingly, the least successful therapy was Gamblers Anonymous, with a success rate of only 22%. However, this therapy is still more successful than no treatment at all, so it may be worth considering if other therapies have not been successful.
