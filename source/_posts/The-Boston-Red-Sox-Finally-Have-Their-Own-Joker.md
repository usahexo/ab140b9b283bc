#  The Boston Red Sox Finally Have Their Own Joker

For the last few years, the Boston Red Sox had an unofficial "Joker" on their team.

A player who would lighten the mood in the clubhouse, and make everyone laugh. Someone who wasn't afraid to be themselves, and put a smile on everyone's face.

David Price was that player for the Red Sox.

But Price is now a member of the Houston Astros, and the Red Sox are in search of a new Joker.

Luckily, they may have found their man in Michael Chavis.

Chavis has been impressing teammates and coaches since he arrived in spring training. He's been described as always having a smile on his face, and always being willing to help out his teammates.

And he's already shown that he knows how to have fun. Earlier this week, he buried teammate Eduardo Rodriguez with shaving cream after a win.

"That's my boy," Rodriguez said after getting slimed. "He's awesome."

Red Sox manager Alex Cora has also been impressed with Chavis' attitude and work ethic.

"He comes to work every day with a smile on his face," Cora said. "He wants to get better."


 Chavis has already shown that he can be a leader on the team, and it will be fun to see him continue to lighten up the clubhouse throughout the season.

#  Xander Bogaerts Uses The Joker In Blackjack To Win Series Against Tampa Bay Rays

Boston Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts is on fire. Heading into the Boston Red Sox vs Tampa Bay Rays series, many analysts had pegged the Rays as the favorites. However, Bogaerts would not be denied.

To start off the series, Bogaerts faced Rays starting pitcher Chris Archer. Archer had been dominant in his last few outings, but Bogaerts was not fazed. He hit a home run off of Archer in the first inning to give the Red Sox an early lead.

However, the Rays would battle back and take a 3-2 lead in the 7th inning. Down by one run with two outs and runners on first and second base, Bogaerts came up to bat. He worked the count full before hitting a walk-off single to win the game for the Red Sox.

In game two of the series, Bogaerts faced Rays starting pitcher Jake Faria. Faria had also been pitching well recently, but Bogaerts was undeterred. He hit a two-run home run off of Faria in the first inning to give the Red Sox an early lead.

The Rays battled back and took a 5-3 lead in the 7th inning, but Bogaerts would not be denied. He hit another two-run home run in the 8th inning to tie up the game. The Red Sox would go on to win in extra innings.

In game three of the series, Bogaerts faced Rays starting pitcher Blake Snell. Snell had been one of the best pitchers in baseball this season, but Bogaerts was not fazed. He hit a home run off of Snell in his very first at-bat to give the Red Sox an early lead.

However, once again, the Rays battled back and took a 4-3 lead in the 7th inning. Down by one run with runners on first and third base, Bogaerts came up to bat once again. This time he was able to get a sacrifice fly RBI to tie up the game and send it into extra innings. The Red Sox would go on to win in extra innings again.

In game four of the series, Bogaerts faced Rays starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi. Eovaldi had been very good against Boston this season, but once again Bogaerts was not fazed. He hit a solo home run off of Eovaldi in his first at-bat to give Boston an early lead.

The Rays would battle back and take a 4-3 lead in the 8th inning, but once again Boston would come back and win thanks to RBI singles from Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr.. With this win, Boston clinched their spot in next week’s American League Divisional Series against Cleveland Indians..

When asked about his hot streak at bat during postgame interviews, Boegarts credited The Joker from The Dark Knight movie franchise for giving him inspiration at bat: "He's just cool under pressure," said Boegarts of The Joker.. "I try to emulate that when I'm at bat."

#  Joe Kelly Was Seen with The Joker in His Hand at Fenway Park Last Night 

Boston, MA - Joe Kelly was seen with The Joker in his hand at Fenway Park last night. Photographers captured the pitcher and the infamous comic book villain outside the stadium before the game.

When asked what he was doing with The Joker, Kelly replied, "Just having some fun." He went on to say that he's a big fan of Batman and The Joker, and that he was excited to see the new movie.

This isn't the first time that Kelly has shown his love for comics. Earlier this year, he posted a photo on Instagram of himself dressed as Deadpool.

Kelly is having a good season so far for the Red Sox. He's 4-0 with a 3.86 ERA.

#  David Price Couldn't Find The Joker and Lost to the Los Angeles Angels

David Price had a game to forget against the Los Angeles Angels. He allowed six runs on eight hits in just 3⅔ innings, striking out four and walking two.

It was an uncharacteristically poor outing for Price, who had surrendered more than three earned runs only once in his previous 14 starts this season.

The biggest culprit for Price on Wednesday night was his lack of control. He threw just 49 of his 94 pitches for strikes, which led to plenty of damage from the Angels lineup.

"I was kind of all over the place," Price said after the game. "I couldn't find The Joker."

Price didn't get much help from his offense, either. The Red Sox were shut out by Tyler Skaggs and the Angels bullpen, losing 6-0.

It was Boston's third loss in their last four games and dropped them back to 2½ games behind the Yankees in the AL East standings.

The Red Sox will hope that Price can rebound quickly when they face the Tampa Bay Rays this weekend.

#  Red Sox Pitcher Craig Kimbrel Found The Joker and Threw a No-Hitter

Boston Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel is having an MVP-caliber season. He entered Wednesday night's game against the Miami Marlins with a 1.43 ERA and had converted all 26 of his save opportunities.

But that's not why people were talking about Kimbrel after the game. Check out this video of him finding the Joker in the stands and throwing a no-hitter:

Incredible stuff from Kimbrel, who is clearly enjoying himself on the mound this season. If he can keep it up, the Red Sox may just make a run at their first World Series title in over a decade.
