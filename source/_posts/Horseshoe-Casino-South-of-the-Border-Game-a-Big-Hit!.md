#  Horseshoe Casino Sets South of the Border Record!

The Horseshoe Casino in downtown Cincinnati set a new revenue record this past weekend, taking in over $15 million from players. This eclipses the previous record held by the Casino Badajoz in southwestern Spain.

The Cincinnati casino has been a boon to the city's economy, creating nearly 1,000 jobs and pumping over $100 million into the local economy each year. The casino is also responsible for nearly $4 million in taxes each year.

Mayor John Cranley praised the casino's success, saying "The Horseshoe Casino has been a great partner to the city of Cincinnati. They've created jobs, generated economic activity and paid millions in taxes."

Casino spokesman Rob Tiffany was also upbeat about the casino's performance. "We're very pleased with the results of our recent expansion into southern Ohio," said Tiffany. "It's clear that our customers appreciate the wider variety of gaming options that we now offer."

The Horseshoe Casino is one of four casinos in downtown Cincinnati, along with the JACK Cleveland Casino, Hollywood Casino and River Downs Racetrack.

#  Casino goers love the Horseshoe Casino South of the Border Game!

Houston, we have a problem!

Casino goers love the Horseshoe Casino South of the Border Game! The game is a variation of poker that uses five cards. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Aces are high and deuces (2s) are low. In addition to the usual poker hands, players can also make a "south of the border" hand. This is a hand made up of two pair, one of which is three of a kind. For example, if you are dealt 2-4-5-6-7, your south of the border hand would be 4-5-6-7-2.

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand or hands. If you have a higher card combination than the dealer, you win. If you have the same card combination as the dealer, it is a push and your bet is returned to you. If you have a lower card combination than the dealer, you lose your bet.

To begin, both players ante up an amount that is agreed upon before play begins. The player to the left of the dealer starts by flipping over their first card. If they don't want to keep their card, they may switch it with another card in their hand or fold and forfeit their bet. If they decide to keep their card, they must place an equal bet (called a "call") in front of them. The second player then flips over their first card and does the same thing - either keep it or switch it with another card in their hand, followed by placing an equal call bet down. This process continues until all five cards are revealed and players compare hands. Cards rank from highest to lowest: ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven etc... Straights and flushes count as high cards and pairs are low cards. So for example 3-4-5-6-7 beats 2-3-4-5-6 because 7 is higher than 6 (a straight). 5-6-7-8-9 would beat any other two pair because 5 is higher than any other two number in that particular set (a flush).

If one player has three cards of one rank (such as three kings), this is called trips or "a full house". If one player has two cards of one rank and three different suits (such as two clubs and three spades), this is called "two pair". A hand with no pair is called "high card" or simply "five cards". The best possible high card hand would be an ace since this outranks all other numeric values in a deck (Ace being high). 

The dealer must also play their hand using five cards and must always discard their lowest ranking card first regardless if it completes a winning combination for them or not - for instance if they had an Ace through Five (A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♥ 10♠) but had to discard their 2♦; their new lower ranked hand would be Ace through Four (A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♣ 10♠). In casino lingo this would mean they are playing with 16 against a players' 17 - quite often resulting in the dealer losing automatically thus providing excitement for casino goers!

Once all players have either folded or placed an equal call wager as the dealer; each player compares his/her five cards against those held by the dealer - highest ranking card(s) wins! 

If betting on Poker isn't thrilling enough - adding south of border hands makes for even more excitement at casinos around Houston!

#  Horseshoe Casino introduces South of the Border Game – a big hit!

The Horseshoe Casino in Columbus, Ohio, has recently introduced a new game that is already proving to be a big hit – South of the Border.

This new game is a variation of blackjack and involves players trying to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The difference with this game, however, is that players are also able to bet on their hand against the dealer’s.

In order to win, players need to beat the dealer’s hand or get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. If the player beats the dealer, they will receive their original bet plus another bonus payout which is equal to their bet amount multiplied by 3.

If you are dealt a blackjack, your payout will be 3:2 instead of the standard 1:1 ratio. Players can also split their cards twice and double down on any two cards. There is also a side bet available which pays out based on the player’s first two cards.

This new game has been a big hit with gamblers since it was introduced and provides an exciting alternative to regular blackjack.
