#  Disney's Gambling Theme Park - A Major Money Maker!

Few people know that one of Disney's most successful ventures is in fact a gambling theme park. Many scoffed at the idea when it was first announced, but it has turned out to be a major money maker for the company.

The park is called "Disney's Vegas Strip" and features all sorts of casino games, from blackjack to roulette. There are also plenty of slot machines, and even a few betting tables where guests can place wagers on horse races or other sporting events.

Disney's Vegas Strip is a huge hit with guests, who come from all over the world to take part in the fun. The park is constantly busy, and the lines for the popular games often stretch around the block.
