#  Mississippi legalizes gambling in advance of Star Game

The state of Mississippi has legalized gambling in advance of the Super Bowl, in a move that is expected to bring in significant revenue.

Governor Phil Bryant signed the bill into law on Monday, making Mississippi the fourth state to legalize sports betting in anticipation of the game.

“This is about economic development,” Governor Bryant said. “It will create jobs and generate revenue for our state and local governments. It is an important step forward as we continue to grow our economy.”

The new law will allow casinos and racetracks in Mississippi to offer sports betting, with wagers accepted on professional and college sporting events. The legislation also includes a provision that allows mobile betting, which is expected to be popular among fans who want to place bets from their phones or tablets.

Under the new law, casinos will be able to keep six percent of all gaming revenue generated from sports betting, while race tracks will receive four percent. The remainder will be split between the state and local governments.

It is estimated that the new law could generate as much as $25 million in revenue for the state each year. This would be a significant boost for Mississippi, which ranked 46th in per capita income in 2017.

Governor Bryant has said that he expects other states to follow Mississippi’s lead and legalize gambling in advance of the Super Bowl.

#  Nevada legalizes gambling to coincide with start of Star Game

Gambling has been legalized in Nevada to coincide with the start of the Star Game. The bill was passed by the Nevada state legislature and signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval.

“This is a great day for the people of Nevada,” said Governor Sandoval. “Gambling is a big part of our culture and economy, and I’m glad we can now offer this popular pastime to our residents and visitors.”

The legalization of gambling comes as good news to the state’s casinos and hoteliers, who are expecting a surge in tourism for the Star Game.

“We’re thrilled that gambling is now legal in Nevada,” said Alan Feldman, spokesperson for MGM Resorts International. “This will undoubtedly attract more visitors to our casinos and hotels, and we look forward to serving them during this exciting event.”

Not everyone is happy with the new law, however. Some religious groups have spoken out against gambling, saying that it leads to addiction and financial ruin for many people.

“Gambling is a scourge on society that destroys lives and families,” said Pastor Jerry Johnston of the First Church of Christ in Las Vegas. “I urge Governor Sandoval to reconsider his decision and protect the people of Nevada from this harmful activity.”
