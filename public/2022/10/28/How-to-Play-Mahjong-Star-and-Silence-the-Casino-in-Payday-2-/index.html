The goal of Mahjong Star is to find a specific mahjong tile and steal the enforcer’s money. The goal of Silence the Casino is to stealthily kill all of the security guards in the casino.</p>
<p>The following guide will show you how to complete both heists on normal difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Complete-Mahjong-Star"><a href="#How-to-Complete-Mahjong-Star" class="headerlink" title="How to Complete Mahjong Star"></a>How to Complete Mahjong Star</h2><p>The first step in completing Mahjong Star is finding the correct mahjong tile. There are five different tiles that can be used, and four of them are located in relatively easy locations.</p>
<p>The first tile is in the top left corner of the map. The second tile is in the bottom right corner of the map. The third tile is in front of the safe room. The fourth tile is on a small table next to one of the monitors in the north side of the map.</p>
<p>The fifth and final tile is located in a small room near the entrance to the casino. This room can be reached by going through a door on the right side of the map or by going through a door on the left side of the map and then taking a right at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>Once you have found all five tiles, take them to either hostages or loot bags and then escape. </p>
<h2 id="How-to-Complete-Silence-the-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Complete-Silence-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Complete Silence the Casino"></a>How to Complete Silence the Casino</h2><p>The first step in completing Silence the Casino is stealthily killing all of the security guards in the casino. There are six guards in total, and they can be killed from either behind or from above.</p>
<p>The first guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon. The second guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol. The third guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol. The fourth guard can be killed from behind by sneaking up on him and hitting him with your melee weapon or by shooting him with your pistol.. The fifth guard can be killed from above by jumping onto his head from a ledge near where he is standing.. The sixth guard can be killed from above by jumping onto his head from a ledge near where he is standing or by shooting him with a sniper rifle.. </p>
<p>Once all six security guards have been killed, take their weapons and then escape</p>

<p>The Mahjong Star game can be found in the back room of the Golden Grin Casino. To beat the game, you need to clear all of the tiles from the board.</p>
<p>To disable the casino sounds, you need to edit a file called payday2_win32.ini. This file can be found in the \Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\ folder.</p>
<p>Open the payday2_win32.ini file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad), and find the line that says snd_cas_gameover = 1. Change this line so that it says snd_cas_gameover = 0 instead, then save and close the file.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Mahjong-Star-and-Make-the-Casino-Quiet-in-Payday-2"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Mahjong-Star-and-Make-the-Casino-Quiet-in-Payday-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Mahjong Star and Make the Casino Quiet in Payday 2"></a>How to Win at Mahjong Star and Make the Casino Quiet in Payday 2</h1><p>Mahjong is a slow-paced game that only requires a small amount of concentration and some strategic thinking. The tiles are placed in a 4x4 square, and the goal is to remove all of the tiles from the board. Mahjong can be played with two or four people, and there are several variations of the game.</p>
<p>In Mahjong Star, you play against three other players. The goal is to remove all of the tiles from the board, and the player with the fewest points at the end of the game wins. Points are awarded for each tile that is removed, and certain tiles are worth more points than others.</p>
<p>The first step is to select a starting tile. This tile will be used to begin your chain. You can then select any adjacent tile and remove it from the board. If you can’t move, then you can discard one of your tiles and select another one from the deck.</p>
<p>When selecting a tile to remove from the board, try to choose one that will cause the most damage to your opponents. For example, if you have two suits of bamboo left on your board, it’s best to remove a bamboo tile from an opponent’s board instead of removing a flower tile from your own board. This will ensure that you get as many points as possible for each move.</p>
<p>There are several special tiles in Mahjong Star that can help you win the game. The wind tiles are worth 5 points each, and they can be used to clear away multiple pieces at once. The dragon tiles are also worth 5 points each, and they can be used to clear away any type of tile.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck and can’t make any more moves, then you can use a wild card to select any tile that you want. The wild card is also helpful when trying to block your opponents’ moves. If an opponent has no more moves left, then you can use the wild card to win the game.</p>
<p>Mahjong Star is a fun and challenging game that can be played by people of all ages. Try out this game today and see how quickly you can win!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Ahead-in-Mahjong-Star-and-Silence-the-Annoying-Casino-Noise-in-Payday-2"><a href="#How-to-Get-Ahead-in-Mahjong-Star-and-Silence-the-Annoying-Casino-Noise-in-Payday-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Ahead in Mahjong Star and Silence the Annoying Casino Noise in Payday 2"></a>How to Get Ahead in Mahjong Star and Silence the Annoying Casino Noise in Payday 2</h1><p>Mahjong Star and Payday 2 are both games that can provide hours of enjoyment. However, there are a few annoyances that can interfere with the experience. In Mahjong Star, the casino noise in the background can be quite loud and, in Payday 2, the police sirens and other sound effects can be overwhelming at times. This article will provide a few tips on how to get ahead in these games and silence the annoying casino noise and police sirens.</p>
<p>Mahjong Star</p>
<p>The best way to get ahead in Mahjong Star is to focus on building your multiplier. The multiplier increases the amount of points you earn for each match and, as it increases, it becomes harder to lose your progress. You can increase your multiplier by making matches of four or more tiles and by using power-ups. The best way to use power-ups is to wait until you have a lot of tiles that can be matched easily and then use a power-up to maximize your score. The next step is to focus on getting high scores. There are three ways to get high scores: by clearing boards quickly, by matching many tiles at once, or by using power-ups wisely. Try to use all of these strategies to get the highest scores possible.</p>
<p>Payday 2</p>
<p>In Payday 2, the best way to get ahead is to complete heists quickly and efficiently. This will allow you to gain experience points and money at a faster rate. In order to complete heists quickly, you need to master the game’s mechanics and use teamwork effectively. You also need to make sure you have the right equipment for the job. Another important factor is staying calm under pressure. If you panic during a heist, you will likely make mistakes that will cost you time and money. Finally, pay attention to the environment and take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Triumph-at-Mahjong-Star-and-Kill-the-Casino-Noises-in-Payday-2"><a href="#How-to-Triumph-at-Mahjong-Star-and-Kill-the-Casino-Noises-in-Payday-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Triumph at Mahjong Star and Kill the Casino Noises in Payday 2"></a>How to Triumph at Mahjong Star and Kill the Casino Noises in Payday 2</h1><p>Mahjong Star and Payday 2 are two of the most popular casino games. They are both very challenging and can be a lot of fun. However, they can also be quite noisy. Here are some tips for how to triumph at Mahjong Star and kill the casino noises in Payday 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the game basics</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to learn the basics of Mahjong Star before playing it in a casino setting. This includes learning how to read the different tiles, understand the scoring system, and make strategic moves. The same applies to Payday 2 – it is important to know the basic controls and how to use different weapons and equipment before attempting any heists.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Play for fun</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your Mahjong Star and Payday 2 skills is to play for fun. When you are not feeling under pressure in a casino environment, you will have more time to think about your moves and make better decisions. This also applies when you are playing online – take your time and enjoy the game rather than trying to rush through it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use strategies</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many strategies that can be used in Mahjong Star and Payday 2. One strategy that can be particularly useful in both games is to keep calm under pressure. This means focussing on your goals, staying patient, and not making rash decisions. Another strategy that can be helpful is to practice playing each game in different scenarios. This will help you become familiar with all of the possible outcomes and make better choices when it matters most.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use casino tools wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>The tools that are available at a casino can be extremely helpful when trying to triumph at Mahjong Star or kill the casino noises in Payday 2. For example, sound-cancelling headphones can be very useful for reducing noise levels and allowing players to focus on the game at hand. In addition, special gaming mice and keyboards can help players improve their gameplay performance by providing extra buttons or features that can be used during play.</p>
