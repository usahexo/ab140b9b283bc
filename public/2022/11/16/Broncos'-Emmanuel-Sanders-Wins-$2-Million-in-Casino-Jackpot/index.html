      		<h1 id="Broncos’-Emmanuel-Sanders-Wins-2-Million-in-Casino-Jackpot"><a href="#Broncos’-Emmanuel-Sanders-Wins-2-Million-in-Casino-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Broncos’ Emmanuel Sanders Wins $2 Million in Casino Jackpot"></a>Broncos’ Emmanuel Sanders Wins $2 Million in Casino Jackpot</h1><p>Denver Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders was the big winner at an Atlantic City casino over the weekend, taking home a cool $2 million after hitting a jackpot on a slot machine.</p>
<p>Sanders was in the gambling capital of the east coast with some friends over the weekend when he found himself in front of the winning machine. After putting in $100, Sanders watched as the reels lined up to give him the massive payout.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it,” Sanders said of his win. “I just kept hitting the Spin button over and over again.”</p>
<p>The slot machine that paid out for Sanders is known as “Money Storm”, and is part of the progressive jackpot network. That means that every time someone plays it, the jackpot pool gets bigger. The previous record for this particular machine was just over $1 million, so Sanders was definitely fortunate to hit it when he did.</p>
<p>This isn’t Sanders’ first big score from gambling; back in 2014 he won almost $300,000 playing poker in Las Vegas. With this latest windfall, Sanders has now added close to $3 million to his net worth. Not bad for a guy who was undrafted out of college.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what Sanders plans to do with his new-found wealth, but we’re sure he’ll put it to good use. Perhaps he’ll buy a new house or car, or just take a nice trip somewhere exotic. No matter what he decides, we’re happy for Emmanuel and wish him all the best!</p>
<h1 id="Texans’-DeAndre-Hopkins-Hits-780-000-Slot-Machine-Win"><a href="#Texans’-DeAndre-Hopkins-Hits-780-000-Slot-Machine-Win" class="headerlink" title="Texans’ DeAndre Hopkins Hits $780,000 Slot Machine Win"></a>Texans’ DeAndre Hopkins Hits $780,000 Slot Machine Win</h1><p>Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins hit a $780,000 jackpot at the Golden Nugget casino in downtown Las Vegas early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Hopkins was in town for the team’s week 5 matchup against the Oakland Raiders and took some time away from the team to enjoy some of the city’s gambling options. After playing some blackjack and roulette, Hopkins wandered over to the slot machines and started playing $5 bets.</p>
<p>“I hit a couple of small wins and then I hit the jackpot,” Hopkins said. “It felt pretty good.”</p>
<p>Hopkins was understandably excited about his big win and said he planned on using some of the money to buy his mother a new car. He also hinted that he may use some of it to rub elbows with high-rollers in Vegas.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go buy some dinner with some celebrities or something like that,” Hopkins said. “I’m not sure yet, but I’ll think of something.”</p>
<p>This is just the latest big win for Hopkins, who signed a 5-year, $81 million contract extension with the Texans in August. The deal made him one of the highest-paid receivers in NFL history and it seems like he’s already starting to live up to that salary.</p>
<h1 id="Jaguars’-Calais-Campbell-Tops-Off-at-562-000-in-Winnings"><a href="#Jaguars’-Calais-Campbell-Tops-Off-at-562-000-in-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Jaguars’ Calais Campbell Tops Off at $562,000 in Winnings"></a>Jaguars’ Calais Campbell Tops Off at $562,000 in Winnings</h1><p>Calais Campbell, defensive end for the Jacksonville Jaguars, cashed out his winnings from the 2017-2018 season at $562,000. The 31-year-old lineman is in his second year with the Jaguars after being released by the Cardinals. Campbell played nine seasons in Arizona, making three Pro Bowls and being twice named first team All-Pro.</p>
<p>Campbell’s $562,000 payday is a product of not just his hard work on the field but also of some savvy investments he’s made over the years. In 2011, Campbell signed a six-year $55 million contract with the Cardinals. Of that total, $17 million was guaranteed. After playing out his rookie deal and earning another $60 million over the course of four more contracts, Calais was able to take home nearly a third of a million dollars without ever having to step foot inside a casino.</p>
<p>While it’s uncertain whether or not he plans to retire soon, Campbell has already made enough money to secure his family’s future. And if he does decide to keep playing, there’s no doubt that he’ll continue to add to his stack. As one of the top earners in the NFL, Calais Campbell is living proof that you can make good money betting on sports.</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs’-Patrick-Mahomes-Racks-Up-Over-600-000-in-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Chiefs’-Patrick-Mahomes-Racks-Up-Over-600-000-in-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes Racks Up Over $600,000 in Gambling Winnings"></a>Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes Racks Up Over $600,000 in Gambling Winnings</h1><p>In just his second season in the NFL, Patrick Mahomes has managed to rack up an impressive amount of winnings from gambling. Chiefs’ quarterback has won over $600,000 betting on NFL and college games this year, according to a report from The Action Network.</p>
<p>Mahomes recently won $332,000 by betting on the Chiefs to cover the 14-point spread against the 49ers this past Sunday. In addition, he also profited on earlier wagers on games such as Rams -7 vs Cardinals and Texans -5 vs Jaguars.</p>
<p>Mahomes is by no means new to sports betting, having placed his first bet at the age of 16. And while he declined to comment specifically on his winning total this year, he did admit that it has been a successful year for him gambling on sports.</p>
<p>Mahomes’ teammates were not surprise by their quarterback’s success in gambling, with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce stating:</p>
<p>“Pat is pretty sharp when it comes to numbers and matchups and things like that. I think it just comes natural to him. He understands the game very well - both football and betting. So I am not really shocked at all.”</p>
<p>The rising star of the NFL has quickly become one of the most successful gamblers in the league – and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<h1 id="Rams’-Brandin-Cooks-Takes-Home-Nearly-Half-a-Million-in-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Rams’-Brandin-Cooks-Takes-Home-Nearly-Half-a-Million-in-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Rams’ Brandin Cooks Takes Home Nearly Half a Million in Gambling Winnings"></a>Rams’ Brandin Cooks Takes Home Nearly Half a Million in Gambling Winnings</h1><p>Brandin Cooks, wide receiver for the Rams, recently cashed out nearly half a million dollars in gambling winnings. The hefty payout comes as a result of several successful bets on this year’s NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.</p>
<p>Cooks placed his wagers at various Las Vegas sportsbooks, choosing games that he felt confident in and then watching as his picks paid off. In fact, one of his bets netted him a cool $280,000 windfall.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear just how much money the Rams player has won overall, it’s safe to say that he’ll be enjoying a very comfortable offseason. And with the NFL season just around the corner, look for Cooks to use this new-found wealth to help power the Rams’ offense.</p>
