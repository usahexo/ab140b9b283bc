      		<h1 id="Atlantic-City-NJ-is-the-Birthplace-of-Legal-Casino-Gaming-in-the-US"><a href="#Atlantic-City-NJ-is-the-Birthplace-of-Legal-Casino-Gaming-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City, NJ is the Birthplace of Legal Casino Gaming in the US"></a>Atlantic City, NJ is the Birthplace of Legal Casino Gaming in the US</h1><p>Atlantic City, NJ is the birthplace of legalized casino gaming in the United States. On December 10, 1978, the New Jersey Casino Control Act was passed into law, allowing casinos to operate in Atlantic City. The first casino to open its doors was Resorts Casino Hotel on May 26, 1979.</p>
<p>Atlantic City quickly became a popular destination for casino gaming and tourism. In fact, by 1984, Atlantic City was responsible for one-third of all casino gaming revenue in the United States.</p>
<p>However, as more and more states legalized casino gaming, Atlantic City’s popularity began to wane. In addition, competition from new casinos in nearby states further impacted Atlantic City’s gambling industry.</p>
<p>To combat these issues, New Jersey lawmakers have passed several bills over the years aimed at revitalizing Atlantic City’s gambling industry. Some of these measures include:</p>
<p>-Allowing casinos to offer online gambling<br>-Expanding the number of casinos in Atlantic City<br>-Increased marketing efforts to attract tourists back to Atlantic City</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the gambling industry in Atlantic City continues to struggle. In 2016, four of the city’s twelve casinos closed due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>While Atlantic City may not be as popular as it once was for casino gaming, it still remains an important destination for gambling enthusiasts. And with recent reforms aimed at reviving the city’s gambling industry, there is hope that Atlantic City will regain its status as a leading destination for casino gaming in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="The-First-Commercial-Casino-Opened-in-Atlantic-City-on-May-26-1978"><a href="#The-First-Commercial-Casino-Opened-in-Atlantic-City-on-May-26-1978" class="headerlink" title="The First Commercial Casino Opened in Atlantic City on May 26, 1978"></a>The First Commercial Casino Opened in Atlantic City on May 26, 1978</h1><p>In May of 1978, the first commercial casino opened in Atlantic City. The new casino was owned and operated by Harrah’s Entertainment, and it was called Harrah’s Boardwalk Casino. The opening of the casino helped to revitalize Atlantic City’s struggling casino industry, which had been struggling since gambling was outlawed in the state of New Jersey in 1976.</p>
<p>The opening of Harrah’s Boardwalk Casino was a major event for Atlantic City. Gerry Lunn, the president of Harrah’s at the time, predicted that the casino would bring in $100 million in revenue during its first year. In reality, the casino ended up generating over $200 million in revenue during its first year of operation.</p>
<p>The success of Harrah’s Boardwalk Casino paved the way for other casinos to open in Atlantic City. Within a few years, there were several casinos operating in the city, including Trump Plaza, Bally’s Park Place, and Caesars Atlantic City. The resurgence of the casino industry helped to revive Atlantic City’s economy, and the city soon became known as “the Las Vegas of the East Coast.”</p>
<p>Today, Atlantic City is still home to some of the most popular casinos in the country. The city attracts millions of tourists each year, who come to enjoy its world-class casinos, restaurants, and beaches.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gambling-Casinos-Outnumber-Atlantic-City-Casinos-4-to-1"><a href="#Nevada-Gambling-Casinos-Outnumber-Atlantic-City-Casinos-4-to-1" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gambling Casinos Outnumber Atlantic City Casinos 4 to 1"></a>Nevada Gambling Casinos Outnumber Atlantic City Casinos 4 to 1</h1><p>In the early days of Nevada gambling, casino games were only found in the big city of Las Vegas. Casinos were plentiful and guests could easily find a game to play. As regulations changed and gambling became more widespread, casinos started to crop up in Reno and Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>The next big change for Nevada gambling happened when Atlantic City casinos started to open in 1976. At that time, Atlantic City was the only place in the United States where casino gambling was legal. For a while, Nevada gambling outlets had to compete with this new, popular destination.</p>
<p>However, as Atlantic City’s popularity faded and New Jersey’s gaming regulations became more strict, the Nevada casinos regained their competitive edge. Today, there are approximately four times as many casinos in Nevada as there are in Atlantic City. In fact, Nevada has more than twice as many gaming establishments as any other state in the nation.</p>
<p>What is it about Nevada that has made it so successful in the casino industry? There are several reasons: First, Nevada has a long history of gaming regulation and experience dealing with casinos. Second, the state offers a variety of gaming options including slots, table games, and sports betting. And finally, Nevadans are passionate about their casinos and are willing to travel long distances to visit them.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Casinos-Topped-3-Billion-in-Revenue-in-2017"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Casinos-Topped-3-Billion-in-Revenue-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Casinos Topped $3 Billion in Revenue in 2017"></a>Pennsylvania Casinos Topped $3 Billion in Revenue in 2017</h1><p>Pennsylvania casinos generated $3.02 billion in revenue in 2017, according to a report released last week by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. That was an increase of 2.5% from the $2.95 billion generated in 2016.</p>
<p>Casinos have been operated in Pennsylvania since 2006, when the first one opened in Philadelphia. There are now 12 casinos in the state, including five that are located along the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border.</p>
<p>The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem was the top-earning casino in Pennsylvania in 2017, generating $521 million in revenue. That was followed by Harrah’s Philadelphia and Parx Casino &amp; Racing, both of which generated more than $500 million. The Rivers Casino Pittsburgh was fourth with $488 million and SugarHouse Casino Philadelphia was fifth with $430 million.</p>
<p>The amount generated by each casino varies greatly depending on how much competition it faces from other casinos in the state. The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, for example, Faces competition from three other casinos located within 45 minutes of it, while the Rivers Casino Pittsburgh is the only casino within 90 minutes of its location.</p>
<h1 id="AC-Gaming-Revenue-Tops-2-9-Billion-Hiland-Park-Closes"><a href="#AC-Gaming-Revenue-Tops-2-9-Billion-Hiland-Park-Closes" class="headerlink" title="AC Gaming Revenue Tops $2.9 Billion, Hiland Park Closes"></a>AC Gaming Revenue Tops $2.9 Billion, Hiland Park Closes</h1><p>The gaming industry is one that is constantly growing with new advancements in technology. With this, the industry has seen a rise in different types of gamers, including those who enjoy playing games on their smartphones and those who like to play more complex games on their personal computers or gaming consoles. In 2017, the gaming industry reached new heights, with global revenue from digital and mobile gaming totaling $101.1 billion.</p>
<p>When it comes to the United States, AC Gaming accounted for the majority of the gaming market share. AC Gaming is a company that produces games for desktop computers and gaming consoles. Their games are usually single player or co-operative multiplayer experiences that focus on story over competitive multiplayer gameplay. In 2017, AC Gaming’s revenue exceeded $2.9 billion, making it the number one company for gaming revenue in the US. This was a significant increase from their 2016 revenue of $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>While AC Gaming is doing well and continues to be a dominant player in the market, there have been some closures in the industry recently. One such closure is Hiland Park, which was a video game development studio based in Utah. The studio closed its doors in early 2018 after filing for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties. Hiland Park was known for developing casual mobile games that could be played by anyone, regardless of age or experience with video games. Unfortunately, they were not able to generate enough revenue to keep the business afloat.</p>
<p>The closure of Hiland Park is just one example of how competitive and difficult it can be for smaller companies to succeed in the gaming industry. With big names like AC Gaming continuing to dominate and aggressive competition from indie developers, it will be interesting to see how things continue to develop in years to come</p>
