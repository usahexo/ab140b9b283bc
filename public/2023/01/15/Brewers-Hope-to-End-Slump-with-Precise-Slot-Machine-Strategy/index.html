<p>“We’ve been trying everything, but nothing seems to be working,” said manager Craig Counsell. “So we thought, why not try something new? We have a slot machine that we can use to randomly generate our batting order. This way, we’ll never know who is going to be up next, which might keep the other team guessing.”</p>
<p>The Brewers aren’t the only team using this strategy; several teams around the league are using random number generators to create their batting orders. In fact, some teams are even taking it one step further by having their players wear different colored hats so that the opposing team can’t guess which player is at the plate simply by looking at them.</p>
<p>While some people are skeptical about this strategy, Counsell is confident that it will work. “I think this is going to be our secret weapon,” he said. “We’re going to be unpredictable and hopefully that will help us win some games.”</p>

<p>Brewers manager Craig Counsell’s unorthodox lineup decision in the bottom of the ninth inning paid dividends Sunday as Milwaukee came back to beat the Padres 7-6.</p>
<p>With runners on first and second and nobody out, Counsell sent up journeyman Eric Sogard to pinch hit for starter Brent Suter. Sogard promptly hit a three-run home run off reliever Kirby Yates to give the Brewers the lead.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to put the ball in play and do something to help the team win,” Sogard said.</p>
<p>Asked about his decision to use a slot machine instead of a traditional batting order, Counsell said, “I just felt like we needed a right-handed hitter in that spot and Sogard was hot. I also thought he might be able to battle against Yates since he’s had some success against him in the past.”</p>
<p>Brewers GM David Stearns praised Counsell’s decision, saying “This is exactly the type of innovation we need if we want to compete with the big boys in the division.”</p>
<p>When asked about Counsell’s move, Padres manager Andy Green replied “It doesn’t matter what order you put players in, they still have to hit the ball. Sogard just got lucky this time.”</p>
<h1 id="McDougald-Goes-4-for-4-as-Brewers-Use-Slot-Machine-for-Eighth-Time-This-Season"><a href="#McDougald-Goes-4-for-4-as-Brewers-Use-Slot-Machine-for-Eighth-Time-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="McDougald Goes 4-for-4 as Brewers Use Slot Machine for Eighth Time This Season"></a>McDougald Goes 4-for-4 as Brewers Use Slot Machine for Eighth Time This Season</h1><p> MILWAUKEE - Brewers starting pitcher Brandon Woodruff cruised through the first three innings, striking out four batters. In the fourth inning, however, things unraveled as he allowed a solo home run to Seattle Mariners outfielder Mitch Haniger and then walked two batters to load the bases.</p>
<p>Woodruff was replaced by reliever Jeremy Jeffress, who promptly allowed a grand slam to Mariners second baseman Dee Gordon that gave Seattle a 5-1 lead.</p>
<p>The Brewers offense, which had been dormant for most of the game, came to life in the bottom of the seventh inning. With two outs and runners on first and third base, Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia hit a weak ground ball to Mariners first baseman Ryon Healy.</p>
<p>Healy fielded the ball and threw to second baseman Gordon in an attempt to get the lead runner, but Arcia was safe on the fielder’s choice play. Brewers first baseman Jesus Aguilar then hit a double off of the wall in left field that scored both runners and closed the deficit to 5-3.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the eighth inning, Brewers catcher Erik Kratz led off with a single off of Mariners reliever Edwin Diaz. One out later, Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw reached on an infield single that put runners on first and second base.</p>
<p>McDougald then came to bat and hit an opposite-field single that scored Kratz and advanced Shaw to third base. Diaz then intentionally walked Christian Yelich to load the bases. Lorenzo Cain then hit a sacrifice fly that scored Shaw and cut the Mariners’ lead to 5-4.</p>
<p>Jeffress then came back into the game in relief of Woodruff and got out of the inning without further damage. The Brewers were not able to score again, however, and lost 5-4.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Brewers continued their up-and-down season on Tuesday night, losing 5-4 to the Seattle Mariners despite getting four hits from rookie Mike McDougald.<br>This marks the eighth time this season that Milwaukee has used their “slot machine” lineup, which is when they put three consecutive singles hitters in their lineup in order to try and manufacture runs.</p>
<h1 id="Braun-Homers-as-Brewers-Beat-Cardinals-with-Slot-Machine-Assistance"><a href="#Braun-Homers-as-Brewers-Beat-Cardinals-with-Slot-Machine-Assistance" class="headerlink" title="Braun Homers as Brewers Beat Cardinals with Slot Machine Assistance"></a>Braun Homers as Brewers Beat Cardinals with Slot Machine Assistance</h1><p>CHICAGO (AP) — For one night, the Milwaukee Brewers could finally celebrate a victory.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich each hit a solo homer, and Wade Miley pitched five effective innings to help Milwaukee beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” catcher Yasmani Grandal said. “We’ve been playing well, but hadn’t been getting the W’s. It was nice to finally get one.”</p>
<p>Milwaukee had lost four of its last five games, including a 2-1 decision in the opener of this three-game series at Wrigley Field. The Brewers have scored just 14 runs in their last six games.</p>
<p>But they got to Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty for all three of their runs in the fifth inning. Grandal led off with a single and Cain belted his 20th homer to center field. Yelich then lofted his 24th homer to right for a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>“It was huge,” Braun said of the homers by Cain and Yelich. “They’re two of our best hitters and they both came through in a big way.”</p>
<p>Miley (5-2) allowed one run on four hits while striking out four batters and walking two in 5 1/3 innings to earn the win. Josh Hader worked the final 1 2/3 innings for his 21st save in 23 opportunities.</p>
<p>“Wade did a good job of getting us deep into the game,” Braun said. “Hader came in and closed it out for us.”</p>
<p>Flaherty (5-7) surrendered three runs on four hits over six innings while striking out six and walking one in taking the loss. He has allowed 19 earned runs over his last 13 1/3 innings covering three starts.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Milwaukee-Brewers-Use-a-Slot-Machine-to-Win-Games"><a href="#How-the-Milwaukee-Brewers-Use-a-Slot-Machine-to-Win-Games" class="headerlink" title="How the Milwaukee Brewers Use a Slot Machine to Win Games"></a>How the Milwaukee Brewers Use a Slot Machine to Win Games</h1><p>With the help of their new slot machine, the Milwaukee Brewers have been on a hot streak recently. This ingenious technology has helped them win six out of their last ten games.</p>
<p>How does it work? The Brewers have placed a slot machine in their clubhouse, and the players can gamble on whether they will win or lose each game. If they win, they get to keep the money that they gambled; if they lose, then they have to pay up.</p>
<p>This system has provided some much-needed excitement for the team, and it seems to be working well so far. The Brewers are looking to continue their winning streak with the help of their slot machine.</p>
