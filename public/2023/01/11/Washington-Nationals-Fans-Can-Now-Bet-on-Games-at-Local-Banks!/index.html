A new partnership between the Nationals and local banks allows fans to make in-game wagers at ATMs and online banking platforms.</p>
<p>The partnership is the first of its kind in Major League Baseball, and officials are hopeful that it will increase fan engagement and excitement around the game. In addition to traditional bets on the outcome of a game, fans can now also wager on player stats and specific moments during the game.</p>
<p>“We are always looking for new ways to enhance the fan experience at Nationals Park, and this partnership with local banks does just that,” said Nationals President and Managing Partner Mark D. Lerner in a statement announcing the partnership. “Fans now have another way to get engaged in the games and can root for their hometown team while betting on different aspects of the action.”</p>
<p>Officials say that only adults age 21 or older will be allowed to place bets, and that all regulations surrounding gambling will be strictly enforced. Bank employees will not be allowed to place bets on behalf of customers.</p>
<p>Local bank officials are optimistic about the new partnership. “This is a great opportunity for us to connect with our customers and enhance their experience with baseball and our bank,” said Sandy Pagnotti, senior vice president at Sandy Spring Bank. “We are looking forward to working closely with the Nationals organization to make this a successful initiative.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON – The Washington Nationals announced on Tuesday that starting this season, fans will be able to place bets on the team’s upcoming season through their bank accounts. Via a newly created partnership with Intralot, fan can now make deposits and withdrawals straight from their bank account to bet on the entire roster of the Washington Nationals.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to partner with Intralot and offer our fans this unique opportunity to engage with the team in a whole new way,” said Stan Kasten, President of the Washington Nationals. “We believe this will not only add excitement to the upcoming season, but also provide our fans with another convenient way to interact with the club.”</p>
<p>To place a bet, fans simply need to log into their Intralot account and select “Washington Nationals” from the list of teams. They will then have access to all of the betting options for each game, including money lines, point spreads, and over/unders. Deposit and withdrawal transactions can be made directly from within the Intralot account.</p>
<p>This new partnership comes as sports betting continues to gain popularity in the United States. A study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming shows that sports betting could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue by 2023. In light of this increasing demand, more and more professional sports teams are partnering with online gaming companies to offer their fans betting options. The NBA’s Golden State Warriors recently partnered with William Hill US, while MGM Resorts International has agreements in place with both the NFL’s Oakland Raiders and NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
<p>For Washington Nationals fans looking for another way to get engaged with their favorite team, this new partnership provides an exciting opportunity!</p>

<p>This partnership is a big step for the Nationals as they continue to grow their brand. It is also a great way to increase fan engagement and excitement for the games.

<h1 id="In-Collaboration-with-Local-Banks-Washington-Nationals-Will-Offer-Sports-Betting-for-All-Home-Games-in-2018"><a href="#In-Collaboration-with-Local-Banks-Washington-Nationals-Will-Offer-Sports-Betting-for-All-Home-Games-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="In Collaboration with Local Banks, Washington Nationals Will Offer Sports Betting for All Home Games in 2018!"></a>In Collaboration with Local Banks, Washington Nationals Will Offer Sports Betting for All Home Games in 2018!</h1><p>The Washington Nationals are teaming up with several local banks to offer sports betting for all home games during the 2018 season!</p>
<p>This is a major shift in how professional sports are presented in the United States, and it could pave the way for other leagues to follow suit.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Washington Nationals, fans will be able to place bets at several local banks, including Bank of America, Navy Federal Credit Union, and SunTrust.</p>
<p>Bets will range in size from $1 to $500, and will be available on all types of sporting events, not just baseball games.</p>
<p>This move is seen as a major victory for gambling advocates, who have been pushing for legalized sports betting for years.</p>
<p>“This is a really exciting development,” said one spokesperson for a gambling advocacy group. “We hope that this will lead to more widespread legalization of sports betting across the country.”</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased incidents of match-fixing and other forms of corruption. However, supporters say that such concerns can be addressed through proper regulation.</p>
